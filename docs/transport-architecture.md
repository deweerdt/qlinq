# Transport architecture

The public transport API remains in `transport.h`. The Quicly implementation is
split into small internal modules with one-way dependencies toward shared data
types and the wire codec.

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `transport_quicly.c` | Connection lifecycle, socket event loop, and public control/query API |
| `transport_internal.h` | Private shared transport and connection state |
| `transport_config.c` | Default resolution and validation of resource limits |
| `transport_protocol.c` | HELLO negotiation, stream dispatch, datagram receive, and FEC assembly |
| `transport_publish.c` | Reliable/datagram publication, FEC generation, and grouped data flushes |
| `transport_tracks.c` | Small delivery-class validation and profile derivation |
| `transport_wire.c` | Versioned, bounded byte-level encoding and decoding |
| `transport_stream.c` | Atomic stream-frame construction and emission |
| `transport_subscriptions.c` | Track/alias lookup, allocation, and stream binding |
| `transport_memory.c` | Packet arena and FEC assembler allocation ownership |
| `transport_fec_state.c` | Reusable FEC contexts and sent-object repair cache |
| `transport_paths.c` | QUIC-path mapping and physical-path selection |
| `transport_repair.c` | Bounded NACK symbol reconstruction |
| `transport_scheduler.c` | Per-connection path and redundancy planning |
| `transport_tls.c` | Certificate loading and verifier initialization |
| `transport_egress.c` | Owned, bounded queues for packets awaiting socket writability |
| `transport_udp.c` | Portable UDP batch system calls and Linux GSO acceleration |

The protocol and publication engines operate on private state but do not own the
socket event loop. `transport_quicly.c` coordinates lifecycle and polling while
each module owns its invariants. The public header continues to expose opaque
handles.

## Ownership rules

- `transport_memory` initializes and destroys arenas and frame assemblers.
- `transport_subscriptions` is the only code that allocates aliases or changes
  subscription entries.
- `transport_fec_state` owns cached FEC instances and copies of sent objects.
- `transport_stream` emits complete frames in one Quicly egress operation.
- `transport_egress` copies any QUIC packets not accepted immediately by the
  kernel. Quicly is not asked for another batch unless every possible output
  socket has room for one complete batch.
- `transport_wire` is the only code that reads or writes multibyte wire fields.
- Path measurements and scheduler state belong to a connection; one client's
  RTT, loss, or telemetry must never determine another client's schedule.
- Incoming FEC assemblers share a 64 MiB transport-wide memory budget and each
  connection has eight active assembler slots.
- NACK handling sends at most 64 requested symbols per repair and accepts at
  most 16 repair requests per connection per second.
- Event payload pointers are borrowed and valid only during the callback.
- The creating thread owns a transport. Callbacks run synchronously on that
  thread and may call non-driving APIs; recursive ticks, callback destruction,
  and cross-thread operations are rejected.
- HELLO negotiation completes before `TRANSPORT_EVENT_CONNECTED`, so capability
  and effective-limit snapshots are valid inside the connected callback.

`transport_publish_ex` distinguishes delivery, buffering, no recipients,
partial delivery, backpressure, invalid input, and internal failure. The legacy
boolean wrapper returns false for partial delivery and all failures.

`transport_get_stats` reports protocol errors, handshake counts, FEC outcomes,
thread-contract violations, UDP would-block/errors, and current/peak egress
occupancy. `transport_get_conn_stats` adds stable connection IDs, negotiated
limits, authentication state, subscriptions, and receive counters.

Component-level tests cover these ownership and lookup boundaries. End-to-end
tests cover connection establishment, authentication, reliable streams,
datagrams, FEC/NACK recovery, and multipath behavior.
